## Practicing Basic Strings in Julia

*** =instructions

This course site is only equipped to handle either R or Python, because of this you will need to run the code for all Julia exercises on your own computer and copy the answers into R as a comment. 



*** =hint

Here is a hint: Remember to use # for comments

*** =sample_code

```{r}
# What is the 253 Char?




```

*** =solution

```{r}
# What is the 253 Char?
#julia> Char(253)
#'Ã½'
```

*** =sct
```{r}
test_student_typed("Char(253)", not_typed_msg =  "Make sure you use Char()")
success_msg("Great!")
```

Copy this string into Julia to begin:

string = "This is the best Statistical Computing Class I have taken!"

*** =sample_code

```{r}
# Paste what happens when you try to concatenate 'a' and 'b' using and *



# What are the words with the indexing of 8:16?



# Compare string[1] to string[1:1] are these exactly equal? Do this in one line and paste the answer.







```

*** =solution

```{r}
# Paste what happens when you try to concatenate 'a' and 'b' using and *

#julia> 'a' * 'b'
#ERROR: MethodError: `*` has no method matching *(::Char, ::Char)
#Closest candidates are:
#  *(::Any, ::Any, ::Any, ::Any...)

# What are the words with the indexing of 8:16?
#julia> string[8:16]
#" the best"



# Compare string[1] to string[1:1] are these exactly equal? Do this in one line and paste the answer.
#julia> string[1] == string[1:1]
#false
